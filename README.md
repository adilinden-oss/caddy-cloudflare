## Usage

### Using the Pre-built Docker Image

To use the pre-built Docker image, pull it from the GitHub Container Registry:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:latest
docker pull adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:latest
# alpine
docker pull ghcr.io/adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:alpine
docker pull adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:alpine
```
You can use the image in your Docker setup. Here is an example `docker-compose.yml` file:
```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  caddy:
    image: ghcr.io/adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "443:443/udp"
    volumes:
      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - $PWD/site:/srv
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
    environment:
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_api_token

volumes:
  caddy_data:
    external: true
  caddy_config:
```
Defining the data volume as [external](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#external) makes sure `docker-compose down` does not delete the volume. You may need to create it manually using `docker volume create caddy_data`.

Replace `your_cloudflare_api_token` with your actual Cloudflare API token.

## Sample Caddyfile
Here is a sample Caddyfile configuration to get you started. This configuration sets up the ACME DNS challenge provider to use Cloudflare and serves a simple static site.

### Global Configuration (Use DNS Challenge for All Sites)
In this configuration, the ACME DNS challenge provider is set globally, so it applies to all sites served by Caddy.

```
# To use your own domain name (with automatic HTTPS), first make
# sure your domain's A/AAAA DNS records are properly pointed to
# this machine's public IP, then replace "example.com" below with your
# domain name.

{
  # Set the ACME DNS challenge provider to use Cloudflare for all sites
  acme_dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
}

example.com {

    # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * /usr/share/caddy

    # Enable the static file server.
    file_server

    # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
    # reverse_proxy localhost:8080

    # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
    # php_fastcgi localhost:9000

    encode gzip

    tls {
      # No need to specify dns here, it's already set globally
    }
}

another-example.com {
    root * /usr/share/caddy
    file_server
    encode gzip

    tls {
        # No need to specify dns here, it's already set globally
    }
}
```
### Per-site Configuration
```
example.com {
  
    # Set this path to your site's directory.
    root * /usr/share/caddy

    # Enable the static file server.
    file_server

    # Another common task is to set up a reverse proxy:
    # reverse_proxy localhost:8080

    # Or serve a PHP site through php-fpm:
    # php_fastcgi localhost:9000

    encode gzip

    tls {
        dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
    }
}

another-example.com {
    root * /usr/share/caddy
    file_server
    encode gzip

    tls {
        dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
    }
}
```

## Configuration
### Creating a Cloudflare API Token

To use the Cloudflare DNS challenge provider, you'll need to create an API token in your Cloudflare account. Follow these steps to create a token with the necessary permissions:

1. **Log in to Cloudflare**:
   - Go to the Cloudflare dashboard at [dash.cloudflare.com](https://dash.cloudflare.com) and log in with your account credentials.

2. **Navigate to API Tokens**:
   - Click on your profile icon in the top right corner of the dashboard.
   - Select "My Profile" from the dropdown menu.
   - In the left sidebar, click on "API Tokens".

3. **Create a Custom Token**:
   - Click the "Create Token" button.
   - Under the "Custom Token" section, click "Get started".

4. **Configure Token Permissions**:
   - Give your token a name, such as "Caddy DNS-01 Challenge".
   - Set the permissions as follows:
     - **Zone - Zone - Read**: Allows the token to Read DNS Zones
     - **Zone - DNS - Edit**: Allows the token to edit DNS records, which is required for the DNS-01 challenge.

5. **Specify Account and Zone Resources**:
   - Under "Zone Resources", set the following:
     - **Include - All Zones**: If you want the token to work with all your zones.
     - **Include - Specific Zone**: Select the specific zone(s) you want the token to have access to.

6. **Create and Store the Token**:
   - Click the "Continue to summary" button.
   - Review your token settings and click "Create Token".
   - Copy the generated token and store it in a secure place. You will need this token to set up the environment variable in your Caddy configuration.

7. **Set the Environment Variable**:
   - In your deployment environment, set the environment variable `CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN` to the value of the token you just created.

For example, in a Docker environment, you can set this environment variable in your `docker-compose.yml` file:

```yaml
version: "3.7"

services:
  caddy:
    image: ghcr.io/adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:latest
    restart: unless-stopped
    cap_add:
      - NET_ADMIN
    ports:
      - "80:80"
      - "443:443"
      - "443:443/udp"
    volumes:
      - $PWD/Caddyfile:/etc/caddy/Caddyfile
      - $PWD/site:/srv
      - caddy_data:/data
      - caddy_config:/config
    environment:
      - CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN=your_cloudflare_api_token

volumes:
  caddy_data:
    external: true
  caddy_config:
```
Defining the data volume as [external](https://docs.docker.com/compose/compose-file/compose-file-v3/#external) makes sure `docker-compose down` does not delete the volume. You may need to create it manually using `docker volume create caddy_data`.

Replace `your_cloudflare_api_token` with the actual token you generated.

By following these steps, you'll have a Cloudflare API token configured with the necessary permissions to allow Caddy to manage DNS records for the DNS-01 ACME challenge.

### ACME DNS Challenge Configuration
To configure the [ACME DNS challenge](https://caddyserver.com/docs/automatic-https#dns-challenge) provider for all ACME transactions, add the following to your Caddyfile:
```
{
   acme_dns cloudflare {env.CLOUDFLARE_API_TOKEN}
}
```
This configuration sets up the provider to use the Cloudflare DNS module with the API token provided as an environment variable. It ensures that your Caddy server can automatically issue and renew SSL certificates using DNS-01 challenges via Cloudflare.

This setup is the same as specifying the provider in the [tls directive's ACME issuer](https://caddyserver.com/docs/caddyfile/directives/tls#acme) configuration.

## Tags

The [caddy-cloudflare](https://github.com/adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare/pkgs/container/caddy-cloudflare) image on GitHub Container Registry and Docker Hub provides the following tags:

- **`latest`**: 
  - Always points to the most recent stable release of Caddy with the Cloudflare DNS module.
  - Automatically updated to ensure you have the latest features and improvements.

- **`<version>`**:
  - Specific version tags for precise version control and consistency in deployments.
  - Examples include:
    - **`2.7.6`**: Full version tag for Caddy version 2.7.6, ensuring you are using this exact release. 
    
         (eg: ```docker pull ghcr.io/adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:2.8.0``` )
    - **`2.7`**: Minor version tag for the latest patch release within the 2.7 series, allowing for minor updates without breaking changes.
    - **`2`**: Major version tag for the latest release within the 2.x series, providing updates within the major version while maintaining compatibility.

- `alpine`: Always points to the latest stable release of the Alpine-based image.
  - `<version>-alpine`: Specific version tags for the Alpine-based image (e.g., `2.7.6-alpine`).

## Platform Support

The `adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare` image is built to support multiple platforms, ensuring compatibility across a wide range of devices and systems. The supported platforms include:

- **linux/amd64**: Standard x86_64 architecture, commonly used in desktop and server environments.
- **linux/arm64**: ARM 64-bit architecture, used in many modern servers and high-end ARM devices.
- **linux/arm/v7**: ARM 32-bit architecture, widely used in devices like Raspberry Pi.

### Alpine Support

The Alpine-based image provides a lightweight alternative, based on the popular Alpine Linux project. Alpine Linux is much smaller than most distribution base images (~5MB), leading to much slimmer images in general.

#### Benefits of Alpine-based Image

- **Smaller Size**: The image size is significantly reduced, which can be beneficial for faster downloads and reduced storage usage.
- **Minimal Base**: Alpine Linux uses musl libc instead of glibc, making it lightweight. However, this may lead to compatibility issues with software that requires glibc.
- **Customization**: To keep the image minimal, additional tools (such as git or bash) are not included by default. You can customize the image by adding the necessary packages in your Dockerfile.

To use the Alpine-based image, pull it from the GitHub Container Registry or Docker Hub:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:alpine
docker pull adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:alpine
```

### Raspberry Pi Support

This Docker image is optimized for Raspberry Pi, allowing you to deploy Caddy with Cloudflare DNS integration on these popular single-board computers. Whether you are using a Raspberry Pi 3 or the latest Raspberry Pi 4, this image provides the necessary support for seamless operation.

To use the image on a Raspberry Pi, ensure you are running a compatible operating system (such as Raspberry Pi OS) and have Docker installed. You can then pull the image and run it as you would on any other system:

```sh
docker pull ghcr.io/adilinden-oss/caddy-cloudflare:latest
```
